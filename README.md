# Python_Encrypter_Decrypter
It's a mini project for myself. Feel free to use or to point out potential bugs and errors.

In the future I'm planning to make a UI for the encryptor/decryptor, but for now, it gets the job done for me. I've used Fernet for this project, which is not the best for streaming encrypting/decrypting algorithms because the encypted file is a little bit bigger than the original. If im not mistaken, for every 3072 bytes (3Kb) passed in, it prints out 4196 bytes. It still could be optimized in many ways.
